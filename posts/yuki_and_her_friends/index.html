<p>Yuki is a 7-year-old girl who loves spending time with her friends Kennedy, Abby, Wyter and Annika. One sunny day, they were playing in the park when Yuki suggested they play hide and seek. Everyone is excited, so they quickly get started.</p>
<p>Yuki covers her eyes and starts counting while the other kids run and hide. yuki looks around and tries to figure out where they might go. She looked behind the trees and bushes, under the slides and swings, but no one was there.</p>
<p>Yuki got a little frustrated, but she didn&rsquo;t want to give up. She closed her eyes again, counted to ten, and then resumed her search. This time, she thought she heard giggling from behind the big oak tree. yuki ran to the tree, but there was no one there.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yuki felt someone tap her on the shoulder. She turned around and saw Kennedy, behind whom she had been hiding. Kennedy giggles and tries to keep quiet, but Yuki spots her.</p>
<p>Together, Yuki and Kennedy look for the others. They look everywhere, but they can&rsquo;t find anyone. yuki is about to give up when she sees a sneaker peeking out from behind a bush. It was Abby! She had found a perfect hiding place.</p>
<p>One by one, Yuki found Wyter and Annika. they were both laughing and having fun, but they knew the game wasn&rsquo;t over yet. They decided to play it again in a different way, with Yuki hiding first.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful day, full of laughter and adventure. yuki and her friends felt they could conquer the world and nothing could stop them. They knew they had each other&rsquo;s backs, and no matter what, they would always be there for each other.</p>
